This repo consists of a source code of a Python script which detects plagiarism in a textual document using **cosine similarity**.


## How is it Done?

You might be wondering how plagiarism detection on textual data is done, well it ain't as complicated as you may think.

We all know that computers are good with numbers; so in order to compute the similarity between two text documents, the textual raw data is transformed into vectors => arrays of numbers and from that, we make use of basic knowledge of vectors to compute the similarity between them.

This repo contains a basic example on how to do that.


## Getting Started

To get started with the code on this repo, you need to either *clone* or *download* this repo into your machine as shown below;

```bash
https://github.com/Talha4543/Plagiarism-Matcher-Pdf-txt-NLP-Project.git
```

## Dependencies

Before you begin playing with the source code, you might need to install dependencies just as shown below;

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## A Python Library?

Would you like to use a Python library instead to help you compare strings and documents without spending time writing the vectorizers by yourself, then take a look at [Pysimilar](https://github.com/Kalebu/pysimilar).
